## 🧠 About This Project
The goal of this project was to **recreate the Salesforce homepage** using only **HTML and CSS**, without any frameworks.  
By building this, I learned:
- How professional websites use layout grids and alignment (Flexbox & positioning)
- How to structure sections like hero banners, navigation bars, and CTAs
- How to design visually appealing, minimal UIs
- The importance of spacing, typography, and color balance in front-end design

This project helped me take a major step toward becoming a **front-end web developer** and understanding real-world website layouts.
